# Meeting with Riccardo
Went through the two projects.
- Possible meta model hack: create some regression on the missing data
  + Maybe just using the model containing "all users". Ie only from mul-conv to realestate.
- Add user specific bias in RNN model: Wx + Wh + b_u

# Status meeting 25 jan

Todo now:
- Write down the two projects properly with latex and full sentences. Make remarks where we need to explore more. Add references where suitable. Divide into two parts: Method and simulations.

# Advisory meeting 23 jan

In general, work done will be posted in this repo:
https://github.com/simeneide/phd-notes

In specific, since we talked about MCMC and Variational inferences methods, the two implementations are here:

MCMC: https://github.com/simeneide/phd-notes/blob/master/general_notes/bayesian-mf/bayesian_MF.ipynb
Variational Inference: https://github.com/simeneide/phd-notes/blob/master/general_notes/bayesian-mf/SVI-MF.ipynb

And Riccardo were of course very right, the plot I showed was not from MCMC as it produced a correlated distribution. the "VI version" can be shown here:

# Lancaster meeting January 2019
So much happened and I didnt write down before two weeks later.
See own notes in onenote from sessions.

Session 1: Meta-models  
Session 2: Bayes RNN  
Thursday: STOR-i conference
